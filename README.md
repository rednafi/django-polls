## What?

This is the canonical `polls` app from the Django [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/).

## Why?

Experimenting with Django requires you to write a whole bunch of boilerplate code before you can get to the main point. So, I wanted to make it a reusable package. This is also helpful while communciating with people in blogs and tutorials on Django.

## Quickstart

### Use as a library

* Run `pip install django-polls-rednafi`.

* In your Django project's `settings.py` file, add `polls.apps.PollsConfig` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` section.

* Start using the components of the `polls` app. Inspect the [source](./django-polls) to see what models and views are included in the app. It's exactly the same as the polls [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/).


### Use as an app

If you want the entire app and not only the reusable models and view, then:

* Clone this repo.

* Go to `django-polls`.

* Run `python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate`.

* Go to `http://localhost:8000/polls/` and start using the app.
